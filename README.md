# Iris_classification

## Problem Statement: <br>
Our project aims to identify type of Iris flower by leveraging machine learning techniques to classify iris flowers based on their attributes.

## Dataset Description: <br>
We've sourced our data from the famous Iris Flower dataset on Kaggle. This dataset contains measurements of various features of three species of iris flowers. Each iris species has its own unique characteristics, making them ideal candidates for a classification task.

Features:<br>
Sepal Length: Length of the iris flower's sepal.<br>
Sepal Width: Width of the iris flower's sepal.<br>
Petal Length: Length of the iris flower's petal.<br>
Petal Width: Width of the iris flower's petal.<br>
